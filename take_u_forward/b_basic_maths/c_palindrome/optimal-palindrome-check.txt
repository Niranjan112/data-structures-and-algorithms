### Key Idea:

We are trying to reverse only the **second half** of the number and compare it with the **first half**. This allows us to check for a palindrome without reversing the entire number, which is more efficient.

Let’s focus on this block of code:

```java
int reversedHalf = 0;
while (x > reversedHalf) {
    reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + x % 10;
    x /= 10;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `reversedHalf` to `0`. This variable will hold the reversed digits of the second half of the number.

2. **While Loop**: The `while` loop continues until `x` (the original number) is smaller than or equal to `reversedHalf`. This is the key idea: we stop the loop when we've processed half of the digits of `x`.

   * **Why?**: Once `reversedHalf` contains the reversed digits of the second half of the number, the number `x` will contain the first half (or one less than half, for odd-length numbers).

3. **Reversing Process**:

   * `x % 10` extracts the last digit of `x`. For example, if `x = 123`, `x % 10` gives `3`.
   * `reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + x % 10` shifts the existing `reversedHalf` by one place (multiplies it by 10) and then adds the last digit of `x` to it. This builds the reversed number one digit at a time. For example:

     * If `reversedHalf = 0` and `x = 123`, after the first iteration, `reversedHalf` will be `3` and `x` will become `12`.
     * In the next iteration, `reversedHalf` becomes `32`, and `x` becomes `1`, and so on.

4. **Reducing `x`**: `x /= 10` removes the last digit from `x`. After the first iteration, `x` becomes `12` (i.e., the last digit `3` is removed).

5. **Exit Condition**: The loop exits when `x` is smaller than or equal to `reversedHalf`, which means that `reversedHalf` now contains the reversed digits of the second half of the number, and `x` contains the first half (or part of it).

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s take `x = 12321` as an example.

* **First iteration**:

  * `x = 12321`, `reversedHalf = 0`
  * `reversedHalf = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1`
  * `x = 1232`
* **Second iteration**:

  * `x = 1232`, `reversedHalf = 1`
  * `reversedHalf = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12`
  * `x = 123`
* **Third iteration**:

  * `x = 123`, `reversedHalf = 12`
  * `reversedHalf = 12 * 10 + 3 = 123`
  * `x = 12`

Now `x = 12` and `reversedHalf = 123`. The loop ends here because `x` (12) is no longer greater than `reversedHalf` (123). We have reversed half of the number.

---

### Final Comparison:

Now that we have reversed half of the digits of the number, we check if the number is a palindrome by comparing the remaining part:

```java
return x == reversedHalf || x == reversedHalf / 10;
```

* If the number has an **even length**, `x` should be exactly equal to `reversedHalf` because the two halves are symmetric.
* If the number has an **odd length**, the middle digit does not matter for the palindrome check, so we divide `reversedHalf` by 10 to remove the middle digit and compare it with `x`.

---

### Example (cont’d):

For `x = 12321`:

* After the loop, `x = 12` and `reversedHalf = 123`.
* We check:

  * `x == reversedHalf / 10` → `12 == 123 / 10` → `12 == 12`, which is `true`.

Thus, the method returns `true` because `12321` is a palindrome.

For `x = 12345`:

* After the loop, `x = 123` and `reversedHalf = 543`.
* We check:

  * `x == reversedHalf / 10` → `123 == 543 / 10` → `123 == 54`, which is `false`.

Thus, the method returns `false` because `12345` is not a palindrome.

---

### Summary:

* The code reverses the second half of the number and compares it to the first half.
* It avoids reversing the entire number, making it more efficient.
* The comparison accounts for both even- and odd-length numbers.
